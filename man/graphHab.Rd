\arguments{
  \item{res}{

}
  \item{ellipse}{
a boolean : if \code{TRUE}, ellipses are ploted with the coloration of individuals (or rows).
}
  \item{Iselec}{
the individuals to select ; see the details section.
}
  \item{Rselec}{
the rows to select (for a \code{\link{CA} res} object) ; see the details section.
}
  \item{Cselec}{
the columns to select (for a \code{\link{CA} res} object) ; see the details section.
}
  \item{Icoef}{
a numerical coefficient to adjust the individuals selection rule ; see the details section.
}
  \item{Rcoef}{
a numerical coefficient to adjust the rows selection rule (for a \code{\link{CA} res} object) ; see the details section.
}
  \item{Ccoef}{
a numerical coefficient to adjust the columns selection rule (for a \code{\link{CA} res} object) ; see the details section.
}
  \item{figure.title}{
the text label to add before graph title.
}
  \item{graph}{
a boolean : if \code{TRUE}, graphs are ploted.
}
  \item{cex}{
an optional argument for the generic plot functions, used to adjust the size of the elements ploted.
}
}

\details{
The \code{Iselec} argument (respectively \code{Rselec} or \code{Cselec}) is used in order to select a part of the elements that are drawn and described. For example, you can use either :
\cr - \code{Iselec = 1:5} then the individuals (respectively the rows or the columns) numbered 1 to 5 are drawn.
\cr - \code{Iselec = c("name1","name5")} then the individuals (respectively the rows or the columns) named \code{name1} and \code{name5} are drawn.
\cr - \code{Iselec = "contrib 10"} then the 10 active or illustrative individuals (respectively the rows or the columns) that have the highest contribution on the 2 dimensions of the plane are drawn.
\cr - \code{Iselec = "contrib"} then the optimal number of active or illustrative individuals (respectively the rows or the columns) that have the highest contribution on the 2 dimensions of the plane are drawn.
\cr - \code{Iselec = "cos2 5"} then the 5 active or illustrative individuals (respectively the rows or the columns) that have the highest cos2 on the 2 dimensions of the plane are drawn.
\cr - \code{Iselec = "cos2 0.8"} then the active or illustrative individuals (respectively the rows or the columns) that have a \code{cos2} higher to \code{0.8} on the plane are drawn.
\cr - \code{Iselec = "cos2"} then the optimal number of active or illustrative individuals (respectively the rows or the columns) that have the highest cos2 on the 2 dimensions of the plane are drawn.
\cr 
\cr The \code{Icoef} argument (respectively \code{Rcoef} or \code{Ccoef}) is used in order to adjust the selection of the elements when based on \code{Iselec = "contrib"} or \code{Iselec = "cos2"}. For example :
\cr - if \code{Icoef = 2}, the threshold is 2 times higher, and thus 2 times more restrictive.
\cr - if \code{Icoef = 0.5}, the threshold is 2 times lower, and thus 2 times less restrictive.
