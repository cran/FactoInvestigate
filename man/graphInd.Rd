\title{
Individuals factor map
}
\description{
Realise the optimised individuals graph
}

\usage{
graphInd(res, file = "", dim = 1:2, Iselec = "contrib", Icoef = 1, 
         figure.title = "Figure", graph = TRUE, cex = 0.7)
}


\arguments{
  \item{res}{
an object of class PCA or MCA.
}
  \item{file}{
the file path where to write the description in Rmarkdown langage. If not specified, the description is written in the console.
}
  \item{dim}{
a 2 dimensional numerical vector giving the factorial dimensions to use for the representation (by default the first plane).
}
  \item{Iselec}{
the individuals to select ; see the details section.
}
  \item{Icoef}{
a numerical coefficient to adjust the individuals selection rule ; see the details section.
}
  \item{figure.title}{
the text label to add before graph title.
}
  \item{graph}{
a boolean : if \code{TRUE}, graphs are ploted.
}
  \item{cex}{
an optional argument for the generic plot functions, used to adjust the size of the elements ploted.
}
}

\details{
The \code{Iselec} argument is used in order to select a part of the individuals that are drawn and described. For example, you can use either :
\cr - \code{Iselec = 1:5} and then the individuals numbered 1 to 5 are drawn.
\cr - \code{Iselec = c("name1","name5")} then the individuals  named \code{name1} and \code{name5} are drawn.
\cr - \code{Iselec = "contrib 10"} then the 10 active or illustrative individuals that have the highest contribution on the 2 dimensions of the plane are drawn.
\cr - \code{Iselec = "contrib"} then the optimal number of active or illustrative individuals (respectively the variables, the rows or the columns) that have the highest contribution on the 2 dimensions of the plane are drawn.
\cr - \code{Iselec = "cos2 5"} then the 5 active or illustrative individuals that have the highest cos2 on the 2 dimensions of the plane are drawn.
\cr - \code{Iselec = "cos2 0.8"} then the active or illustrative individuals that have a \code{cos2} higher to \code{0.8} on the plane are drawn.
\cr - \code{Iselec = "cos2"} then the optimal number of active or illustrative individuals that have the highest cos2 on the 2 dimensions of the plane are drawn.
\cr 
\cr The \code{Icoef} argument is used in order to adjust the selection of the individuals when based on \code{Iselec = "contrib"} or \code{Iselec = "cos2"}. For example :
\cr - if \code{Icoef = 2}, the threshold is 2 times higher, and thus 2 times more restrictive.
\cr - if \code{Icoef = 0.5}, the threshold is 2 times lower, and thus 2 times less restrictive.
